breakpoint 1
mainA = 1
mainB = 20000
x= 1        
y= 20000

breakpoint 2
mainA = No symbol "mainA" in current context.
mainB = No symbol "mainB" in current context.
we get this because in swap function there is x and y, mainA and mainB is not in function swap.

breakpoint 3
x = 20000
y = 1
x and y are swapped

breakpoint 4
mainA = 1
mainB = 20000
they arent swapped.
x= No symbol "x" in current context.      
y= No symbol "y" in current context.
we get x and y like this because in main function there are mainA and mainB, x and y are local variable in swap function.
